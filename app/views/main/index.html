We do hereby disclaim any liability for damages that may arise from any user providing any services for any purpose that violates any law. You do hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from any liability that may arise should you violate any law.</p>


		<p>B. You do also hereby agree to defend and indemnify us should any third party be harmed by your illegal actions or should we be obligated to defend any claims including, without limitation, any criminal action brought by any party not affiliated with us.</p>

		<h5>XI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:</h5>

		<p>A. In no event shall we (or our licensors, agents, suppliers, resellers, service providers, or any other subscribers or suppliers) be liable to you, or any other third party for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of information, business interruption, revenue, or goodwill, which may arise from any person’s use, misuse, or inability to use our services or any of the materials contained therein, even if we have been advised of the probability of such damages. This is for any matter arising out of or relating to this agreement, whether such liability is asserted on the basis of contract, tort or otherwise, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

		<p>B. In no event shall our maximum total aggregate liability hereunder for direct damages exceed the total fees actually paid by you for use of our services for a period of no more than one (1) month from the accrual of the applicable cause or causes of action. Because some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>
